# Blog-Generation
Complete end-to-end Blog Genrating platform using Llama 2 model by Meta. 
The Llama 2 release offers a range of pretrained and fine-tuned language models with 7 billion to 70 billion parameters (7B, 13B, 70B). These models have significant improvements over Llama 1, including 40% more training data, a much longer context length of 4,000 tokens, and faster inference for the 70B model using grouped-query attention.
